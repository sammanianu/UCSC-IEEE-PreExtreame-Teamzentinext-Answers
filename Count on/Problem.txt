Following function outputs the n-th Fibonacci number. It also a prints a series of 0s and 1s. You should write a program to find the number of 0s and 1s printed by the follwoing function, for given n.

int fibonacci(int n)
    if n equals 0
        print(0)
        return 0
    end

    if n equals 1
        print(1)
        return 1
    end

    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

end
Input Format

Input is a single integer n, between 0 and 40 inclusive.

Output Format

Output should be two space separated integers. First should be the number of 0s printed by the function and the second should be the number of 1s printed.

Sample Input

Explanation

Execution of fibonacci(3)

fibonacci(3) calls fibonacci(2) - A and fibonacci(1) - B
fibonacci(2) - A calls fibonacci(1) - C and fibonacci(0) - D.
fibonacci(1) - C prints 1 and returns 1.
fibonacci(0) - D prints 0 and returns 0.
fibonacci(2) - A returns 1.
fibonacci(1) - B prints 1 and returns 1.
fibonacci(3) returns 2.
In total, '0' is printed once and '1' is printed twice.
