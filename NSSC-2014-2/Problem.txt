FactFibo numbers is a combination of two sets of numbers.

FactFibo(n) = fact(n) + fibo(n)

The two sets of numbers Fact() and Fibo() are mentioned below:

Factorial definition: Factorial definition e.g Fib(4) = Fib(3) + Fib(2)

  Fib(3) = Fib(2) + Fib(1)

  Fib(2) = Fib(1) + Fib(0)= 0 + 1 = 1

  Fib(3) = 1 + 1 = 2

  Fib(4) = 2 + 1 = 3

  FactFibo(4) = Fact(4) + Fibo(4)
The FactFibo(4) in this case is given as a command line argument.
