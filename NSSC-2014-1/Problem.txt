Write a program to display tally characters ( 'I', 'V', 'X', 'Y' and 'Z') for a series of number marks given as input. You have to help by writing the code that would do that as follows:

• To represent number 1 it is okay to use the 'I' character.

• To represent number 5 it is okay to use the 'V' character.

• To represent number 10 it is okay to use the 'X' character.

• To represent number 100 it is okay to use the 'Y' character.

• To represent number 1000 it is okay to use the 'Z' character.

You have to print the number before you display the tally character marks and the input numbers will be integers of a range from 1 to 9999.
