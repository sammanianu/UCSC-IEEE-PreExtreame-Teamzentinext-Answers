Larry has a permutation of  numbers, , whose unique elements range from  to  (i.e.: ). He wants  to be sorted, so he delegates the task of doing so to his robot. The robot can perform the following operation as many times as it wants:

Choose any  consecutive indices and rotate their elements in such a way that  rotates to , which rotates to , which rotates back to .
For example: if  and the robot rotates ,  becomes .

On a new line for each test case, print  if the robot can fully sort ; otherwise, print .

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , the number of test cases. 
The  subsequent lines each describe a test case over  lines:

An integer, , denoting the size of .
 space-separated integers describing , where the  value describes element .
Constraints

Output Format

On a new line for each test case, print  if the robot can fully sort ; otherwise, print .

Explanation

In the explanation below, the subscript of  denotes the number of operations performed.

Test Case 0: 
 
 is now sorted, so we print  on a new line.

Test Case 1: 
. 
. 
 is now sorted, so we print  on a new line.

Test Case 2:
No sequence of rotations will result in a sorted . Thus, we print  on a new line.
