hich card the girl chose. Amazing, right?

You decide to write a program to help you understand the Burt's technique. The program will be given the two arrangements of the cards, and the volunteer's answers to the two questions: the row number of the selected card in the first arrangement, and the row number of the selected card in the second arrangement. The rows are numbered 1 to 4 from top to bottom. 

Your program should determine which card the volunteer chose; or if there is more than one card the volunteer might have chosen (Burt did a bad job); or if there's no card consistent with the volunteer's answers (the volunteer cheated).

Input Format

First line will contain a number T.(No of test cases).

Each test case starts with a line containing an integer: the answer to the first question.
The next 4 lines represent the first arrangement of the cards: each contains 4 integers, separated by a single space. 
The next line contains the answer to the second question, and the following four lines contain the second arrangement in the same format.

Output Format

For each test case, Print one line.

If there is a single card the volunteer could have chosen,Print the number on the card.

If there are multiple cards the volunteer could have chosen, Print "Bad magician!", without the quotes. 

If there are no cards consistent with the volunteer's answers, Print "Volunteer cheated!", without the quotes.

The text needs to be exactly right, so consider copying/pasting it from here.
