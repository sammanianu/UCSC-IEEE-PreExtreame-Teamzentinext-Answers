Two words are matching, if the letters in one word can be remapped to get the second word. That is replacing all occurrences of a letter by another letter. The order of the letters should not change. Each letter should be mapped to a letter. A letter can map to itself, but two letters cannot map to the same letter. and deferent letters can be mapped to different letters.

For example, the words "abca" and "zbxz" are matching because we can map 'a' to 'z', 'b' to 'b' and 'c' to 'x'.

Given a list of words, return how many unordered pairs of words are matching.
